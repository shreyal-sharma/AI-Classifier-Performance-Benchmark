# AI-Classifier-Performance-Benchmark
## Overview
This project focuses on evaluating and comparing the performane of different classification algorithms on a binary classification task. The primary goal is to leverage 10-fold cross-validation to obtain a reliable estimate of each algorithm's performance using a consistent dataset. The evaluation includes detailed performance metrics like Precision, Recall, TSS (True Skill Statistic), HSS (Heidke Skill Score), and others to identify the best-performing model. 

## Objectives
- Implement and compare three classification algorithms:
  - **Random Forest** (Traditional ML)
  - (Deep Learning Classifier)
  - (Traditional ML)
- Perfor **10-fold cross-validation** to assess model performance.
- Manually calculate performance metrics such as **TP, TN, FP, FN, FPR, FNR, TSS, HSS** for each classifier.
- Provide a comprehensive comparison of the algorithms to determine the best-performing model.

## Installation and Setup

To run the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Classifier-Performance-Benchmark.git
cd AI-Classifier-Performance-Benchmark

3. Create a virtual environment (optional):
4. Install the required packages:

## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing:
  - Load the dataset and perform data cleaning (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.).
  - Split data into features (X) and target labels (y).
2. Algorithm Implementation:
 - Implement three classifiers using Python libraries:
   - Random Forest using scikit-learn
   - Deep Learning model using TensorFlow or PyTorch
   - A traditional ML classifier 
  - Use 10-fold cross-validation to assess model performance.
3. Evaluation Metrics
4. Results Analysis

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the [best-performing algorithm] was found to outperform the others due to [reason]. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of using 10-fold cross-validation for evaluating classification models in a consistent and unbiased manner.
